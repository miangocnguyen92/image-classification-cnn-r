# Image Classification with Deep Learning in R

This project explores deep learning concepts using **R** and **torch** to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images into different categories.  
I trained the model on a dataset of **60,000 images** (50,000 training set, 10,000 testing set), then evaluated predictions and visualized misclassified results.

Although this project is not directly related to Business Intelligence, it highlights my curiosity and eagerness to learn advanced analytics and modern AI techniques — skills I bring into BI to enhance data understanding and insight generation.

## Project Overview
- Built a **CNN from scratch** using `torch` in R  
- Trained the model on multi-class image data  
- Implemented data preprocessing, model architecture, training loops, and evaluation metrics  
- Visualized **misclassified images** to understand model weaknesses  
- Explored how deep learning models interpret visual data

## Techniques & Tools
- **R**, **RStudio**
- **torch for R**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- Data preprocessing & augmentation
- Model evaluation & visualization
